# laptop-store-management-system-doubly-link-list
 Laptop Store management system using doubly  link list with insert, search and update  functionality.
 
This project is on Laptop Management system.
Coded in C++ using visual Studio 2010.
Project uses  Doubly link list algorithms, Filing, and 	searching and sorting algorithms.

Functionality of App : 	| Add Laptops | Delete Laptops | Sell Laptop 
			| Show Inventory  | Search Buyer |  Search Laptop 
			| Sort Products 
			| See Number of Products.
			
# How this application works ?
When program starts the user will be given options that are chosen by a integer input. Integer is checked and program will jump to respective control. The added data is stored in link list with a data code given by user. User can delete a laptop with product code, sell a laptop with product code, sort the products , search for a previous costumer and can search in inventory.

# How data structure is working ?
A Doubly link list class files is used for all the functions and algorithms. These functions are used according to the control of program.
Searching buyer data is done with sentinel search  and sorting products is done with bubble sort directly on link list.
As linear search works best on link list. Because of dynamic size. Its used for searching in link list.
Linear Arrays are used to search for the user data. The previous data is fetched form the file and stored in the array. The array size is dynamic and is dependent on the size of data present.
